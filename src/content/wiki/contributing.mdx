Thank you for showing interest in helping improve the language server!

There are many areas in which you can help. This article gives some starting pointers to help you navigate your way to contributing.

## Developing Lua Language Server

If you have some knowledge of Lua, grab the code and start hacking on whatever you wish. You can consult [Build](/wiki/build) and [Developing](/wiki/developing) articles at your convenience. An overview of the project's file structure is found [here](/wiki/developing#file-structure).

After sending a patch, consider writing a short description of your feature/bugfix consider writing a short entry in the project's [changelog.md](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server/blob/master/changelog.md) file, so it's visible to users.

## Contributing LuaCATS Annotations

Lua Language Server's system for annotating code is named LuaCATS, Lua Comment And Type System. You can contribute to our ecosystem by writing LuaCATS annotations for widely used Lua libraries. This gives the language server's users out-of-the-box autocomplete suggestions for use with those libraries.

A general reference to LuaCATS is found in the [Annotations](/wiki/annotations) article. The official place for the annotations is the [LuaCATS organization](https://github.com/LuaCATS). Issue reports and patches to official LuaCATS annotations should be sent to the appropriate repository in that organization.

## Contributing Translations

Lua Language Server supports localization. For an overview of this system with a contributing guide see the [Translations](/wiki/translations) article.

## Writing Documentation

A [guide](https://github.com/LuaLS/LuaLS.github.io/blob/main/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) is available for contributing to this wiki.
